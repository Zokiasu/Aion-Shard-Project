# Project Aion 4.7.5 Custom
Project based on https://github.com/determinated/Aion-Emulator-4.7.5  
Website associated to the project : https://github.com/Rolf1e/aion-4.7.5-web-site  

The project was to reuse the 4.7.5 update of Aion to offer our players a new experience on it. A unique experience, which hadn't been done by any other server we know of yet.
The server offers some PvP custom such as FFA, 1vs1 continuous arena. It is also possible to activate a starting stuff which will be automatically +15.
Some PvE custom have been integrated, such as instance modifications (Statistics, watches, AI).
